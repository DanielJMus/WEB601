# Twitter App
This application is written in node.js and uses the npm Twit module to make calls to the twitter api through the main file index.js

# Intentions
Just playing around for now but I can see how fun this will be with pulling and posting certain information possibly on a timer I could post or retweet news articles in relevance to a topic Id be interested in.
