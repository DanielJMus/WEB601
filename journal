Class Javascript vars functions and gates (Not sure which week) <-- need to org

This class we talked about logic gates functions and variables
You call a function by its name 
function myFunction(){
    console.log("Message");
}

myFunction() <--- this is calling the function

we also talked about association and reserved words in Javascript
function addition(a,b) for example
const doesnt change let can

Ali also talked about our wireframes and website.

talked about order of which the variables are added as the program runs
asynchronous order
