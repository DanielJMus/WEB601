Class Javascript vars functions and gates (Not sure which week) <-- need to org

This class we talked about logic gates functions and variables
You call a function by its name 
function myFunction(){
    console.log("Message");
}

myFunction() <--- this is calling the function

we also talked about association and reserved words in Javascript
function addition(a,b) for example
const doesnt change let can

Ali also talked about our wireframes and website.

talked about order of which the variables are added as the program runs
asynchronous order

installed npm package twit to follow a tutorial on adding outside module and creating a package.json file 
Commands used

npm init
npm install twit --save

I also uninstalled the package as i forgot to add the save tag so tha tis usefull

npm -h <-- used to find the unistall commands
 
***TwitterApp***

Created a twitter bot that posts custom search tweets to a twitter account i created. in the TwitterApp folder

***Project Wireframe and Idea***
I have created a wireframe inside ./WireframeImgs/ that sets out the template css design and colour pallete that will be used in the project. 
This template will be consistant throughout the website having the content area adjusted for columns to accomodate the different pages in the website.

The idea for the website is to build custom api calls to different cryptocurrency platforms. I will have a series of drop down boxes selecting which platform to make a query on and then the different options to create a call to that api and display the output of that api call on screen, then a place to copy the code that was generated to make that call if the user wants to use it in another application. The basic summary is a place to generate and create API calls to a selection of platforms for the user to customise.
